## Book Details

### About this book

Discover more insight about deep learning algorithms with Swift for TensorFlow. The Swift language was designed by Apple for optimized performance and development whereas TensorFlow library was designed by Google for advanced machine learning research. Swift for TensorFlow is a combination of both with support for modern hardware accelerators and more. This book covers the deep learning concepts from fundamentals to advanced research. It also introduces the Swift language for beginners in programming. This book is well suited for newcomers and experts in programming and deep learning alike. After reading this book you should be able to program various state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms yourself.

The book covers foundational concepts of machine learning. It also introduces the mathematics required to understand deep learning. Swift language is introduced such that it allows beginners and researchers to understand programming and easily transit to Swift for TensorFlow, respectively. You will understand the nuts and bolts of building and training neural networks, and build advanced algorithms.

### What You‚Äôll Learn

- Understand deep learning concepts
- Program various deep learning algorithms
- Run the algorithms in cloud

### Who This Book Is For

- Newcomers to programming and/or deep learning, and experienced developers.
-  Experienced deep learning practitioners and researchers who desire to work in user space instead of library space with a same programming language without compromising the speed.

## Setup

- First, you should install the latest Swift for TensorFlow [toolchain](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/main/Installation.md#releases).
- But to run only differentiation-specific code (for instance, the source code of Differentiable Programming chapter) not requiring deep learning features, simply install the latest Swift toolchain snapshot from [Swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) under Trunk Development (main) section. (_The future differentiation feature updates will be posted on this website and will go through the standard [Swift Evolution process](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147)._)
- Then you must select the newly installed toolchain in Xcode from `Preferences (Command + ,) > Components > Toolchains > (Swift for TensorFlow or Swift Development Snapshot)`.

### Running in Terminal

To execute any of them first enter into this package's root directory.
```
cd deep-learning-with-swift-for-tensorflow-book
```

Then run the following command in terminal.
```
swift run AlgorithmicDifferentiation
```

The following output will be displayed.
```
expression value: 30.0
expression derivative: 28.0
```

Just replace `AlgorithmicDifferentiation` with any executable target you wish to run.
